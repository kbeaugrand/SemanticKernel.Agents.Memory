# SemanticKernel.Agents.Memory

This repository contains an advanced **Memory Pipeline** designed to enhance the context management and information retrieval capabilities of **Semantic Kernel** agents. The pipeline integrates various memory storage and retrieval strategies to enable agents to maintain, update, and utilize long-term and short-term memory effectively across interactions.

## Features

- Modular memory components supporting vector stores, databases, and custom memory handlers  
- Efficient embedding and semantic search integration for context-aware retrieval  
- Support for both short-term conversation memory and long-term knowledge persistence  
- Scalable design to accommodate multi-agent systems and complex workflows  
- Easy integration with Semantic Kernel SDK and extensible architecture for custom memory logic  

## Use Cases

- Maintaining conversational context over multiple turns  
- Recalling past interactions and user preferences  
- Storing domain-specific knowledge for improved reasoning  
- Enabling agents to learn and adapt based on historical data
